ANALYZING CUSTOMER CHURN WITH POWER BI

Topic:
    For subscription-based businesses, reducing customer churn is a top priority. In this Power BI project, I am investigating a dataset from an example telecom company called Databel and analyze their churn rates. Analyzing churn doesn’t just mean knowing what the churn rate is: it’s also about figuring out why customers are churning at the rate they are, and how to reduce churn. I am answering these questions by creating measures and calculated columns, while simultaneously creating eye-catching report pages.
